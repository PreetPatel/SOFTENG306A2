# Climate Run
An endless runner based on climate change

The world currently faces a challenge of climate change and what we do now to educate the upcoming generation of youngsters defines the actions that could lead the the recovery or damage of Earth.
Climate Run is a fun endless runner designed for kids of age 12+ to explore the changes that earth is going through such as the melting ice caps in Antarctica; the effects dumping waste into the sea has on beaches and marine life; and the uncontrollable fires in the Amazon rainforest.

The aim of this educational runner is to help kids visualise problems relating to climate change and enabling fun game mechanics which they can use to alter the world. By providing instant feedback of their actions via visually altering the surrounding environment (only available in the Forest level), the player can replay levels to see what consequences certain actions have in the game.
